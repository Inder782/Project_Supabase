Project Description

Interactive Storybook using Object-Oriented Programming:

Objective: Design an interactive storybook where users can choose the
direction of the story based on their decisions.

Specifications:
Create different classes representing story elements: characters, events,
decisions, etc.

As users progress through the story, present them with decision points that
influence the story's direction.
Maintain the state of the story, including past decisions and potential future
paths.

Use the prototype chain to manage shared story elements and inheritance
between different story arcs.

Bonus: Integrate a visual representation, like a tree, showing the story's
branching paths.

made in latest Next.js 14.2
